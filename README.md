# MoreCraft
A simple plugin, which gives you the ability to create custom crafting recipes without needing to know how to code.

## What does it do?
Well, that depends on what you do with it.
Basicly it reads JSON Files from a directory, interprets them and adds them to the recipes on your server.

## What is it able to do?
For now is is just able to Custom generate recipes for enchanted or non-enchanted items.
It also comes in with a handy command (/reloadrecipes) which lets you load new recipes while the server is still active.

## Is that all?
For now? certainly. It is more or less a toy which does not do to much for now.
There is a plan for using custom items in a recipe which is not possible yet.
It is said, there also should be recipes which does not consume their components, but that is just a rumor, I guess.
